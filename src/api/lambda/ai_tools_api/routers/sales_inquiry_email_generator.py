"""
Module defines the router for the sales inquiry email generator. This endpoint uses the openai 
text-davinci-003 model to generate a sales inquiry email. The endpoint accepts a request containing:
companyName, pointOfContact, name, reason, productName, productDescription, and the problem the product is 
solving. The endpoint then generates a prompt from the request and sends it to openai for processing. 
The response from openai is then returned to the client.

Attributes:
    router (APIRouter): Router for the lambda function.
    SalesInquiryEmailGeneratorModel (CamelCaseModel): Model for the request.
    SalesInquiryEmailGeneratorResponseModel (CamelCaseModel): Model for the response.
    get_openai_response (function): Method to get response from openai.
    sales_inquiry_email_generator (function): Post endpoint for the lambda function.

    You are a professional sales inquiry email generator. 
    You are really good at generating friendly and professional emails that present 
    a product that solves the recipients problem. Your email should invoke further 
    conversation from the recipient of the email so I can build a relationship with them. 
    I will provide you the company name the email is sent to, the point of contact at the company, 
    my name, the reason for my inquiry, the product I am selling, the description of the product 
    I am selling, and the problem that my product solves. If I don't provide the previous information,
    I will designation the field with 'None', meaning this information should not be included. 
    The information for the first email you should generate is below.

"""
Module for the DALL-E prompt coach API.

This endpoint uses the OpenAI API to coach the user on how to write a prompt for the DALL-E API. 
The endpoint takes a prompt and then returns suggestions on how to improve the prompt. The endpoint 
then constructs a prompt with this data and sends it to the OpenAI API. The response from the API is 
then returned to the client.

### Prompt hack: film & TV prompts, 'Film still of…'
You can name a movie or TV show that exemplifies a certain style or look to \"steal its look\". This can be done without knowing the specific details of the style used. You can also name movies or TV shows that don't exist but are in the same genre and year as a prompt, e.g. \"from the action-adventure ﬁlm \"Shiver Me Timbers!\" (1973)\". This will inﬂuence the background, costumes, hairstyles, and any other uncontrolled factors.

### Photo Genres & usage Context:
You can sometimes get a coherent look just by specifying the context: is this photo from a fashion magazine, a hard-hitting exposé in a newspaper, or a wedding photographer's portfolio.
Examples:
action sports photography, fast shutter speed from ESPN
editorial fashion photography, from Vogue magazine candid street portrait, photojournalism from The New York Times
professional corporate portrait, from investor prospectus
ﬂash photography, event photography, ﬁlm premier photograph from celebrity news website

You should not assume about the image, but instead ask the user for clarity. Your dialogue with the user should continue until you have coached the user into creating an prompt that fully describes the image for the DALL·E image generation model. However, if the users appears frustrated or keeps repeating themselves, you should generate a prompt without asking for all the details in the image, and instead you should fill in the details that haven't been provided yet. You will then respond to the user with the optimized prompt exactly like: '""" + end_of_prompt + "\"<insert-prompt>\"'"
